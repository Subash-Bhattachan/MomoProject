                        <p>
                            Dumplings are a food that consists of small pieces of dough wrapped around a filling. The
                            filling can be based on flour, potatoes or bread, and may include meat, fish, vegetables, or
                            sweets. They may be cooked by boiling, steaming, simmering or frying. They may have a
                            filling or there may be other ingredients mixed into the dough. Dumplings may be sweet or
                            savory. They can be eaten by themselves, in soups or stews, with gravy, or in any other way.
                            While some dumplings resemble solid water-boiled doughs, such as gnocchi, others such as
                            wontons or ravioli feature a wrapping of dough around a filling.

                            This space is going to discuss this particular way, so that not only the dumplings would
                            look appealing to eyes but would also invite people to give a try out of this savory dish.
                            Most of the knowledge that is being shared here is based on the creatorâ€™s own experience of
                            growing up with making dumplings and feasting on them as a family affair while in Nepal.
                            For some tools required, example the wraps, the creator of this page is used to making your
                            own dough and the shaping to several pieces to wrap the filling. Dumplings are
                            liked everywhere around the world and are consumed in a lot different ways. The creator
                            hopes this digital handbook will help the people to
                            accomplish the skill of their lifetime.
